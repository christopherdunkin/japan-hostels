Repository for the following [visualisation](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOTU3ODhmMzctZmExNy00MWExLTg1ZWYtMjQwMzA2OTdkYTZkIiwidCI6IjhlYWFjM2M2LWRkMmItNDU2Yy1hODA1LTU4NmY5ZWI0OWNiOSJ9) of Japanese hostel data.

The visualisation used Koki Ando's Kaggle [Japan Hostel Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koki25ando/hostel-world-dataset/data). The data was web scraped by Koki Ando from [HostelWorld](https://www.hostelworld.com/) in 2018. HostelWorld is a popular hostel booking website whose mission is to connect travellers. The website has information on hostels all around the world.

We cleaned the dataset and created views necessary for the visualisation (following Power BI best practices) using SQL (MySQL) (first manually changing some column names in the dataset which clashed with SQL keywords). The visualisation itself was created in Power BI, with the violin plot made using Daniel Marsh-Patrick's [visual](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/wa104381947?tab=overview). The SQL script used is included in this repository.

Some points of analysis from the visualisation are:
